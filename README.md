# Cistercian Number System
This is little project is to train a system to learn the Cistercian Number System created by a monk in the 13th century by using only one symbol to represent any number 1 - 9999.

**How they work:**

All Cistercian numerals begin with a vertical line segment, which by itself represents the number 0. Then, glyphs representing the digits 1 through 9 are optionally added to the four quadrants surrounding the vertical line segment. These glyphs are drawn with vertical and horizontal symmetry about the initial line segment. Each quadrant corresponds to a digit place in the number:

 - The upper-right quadrant represents the ones place.
 - The upper-left quadrant represents the tens place.
 - The lower-right quadrant represents the hundreds place.
 - The lower-left quadrant represents the thousands place.
